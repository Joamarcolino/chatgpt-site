                        <p class="text">Sam Altman was born on April 22, 1985, in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in St. Louis,
                            Missouri.
                            From
                            a young age, he demonstrated a strong interest in computers — learning to program by age 8.
                            He
                            went
                            on to study computer science at Stanford University, but like many tech entrepreneurs, he
                            dropped
                            out to pursue a startup career<span class="dots">...</span>

                                In 2005, he co-founded a location-based social networking app called Loopt, which was
                                accepted
                                into
                                the first batch of Y Combinator, the now-famous startup accelerator. Though Loopt wasn’t a
                                massive
                                commercial success, it gave Altman a foothold in the startup world and later sold for $43
                                million.

                    <div class="text-blockscroll">
                        <p class="text">Sam Altman’s career really took off when he joined Y Combinator (YC) full-time. In 2014, he
                            became
                            President of Y Combinator, where he played a key role in funding and mentoring hundreds of
                            startups,
                            including Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, and Reddit. Under his leadership, YC grew into one of the
                            most
                            influential incubators in Silicon Valley.

                                However, Altman’s ambition extended beyond startups. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI alongside
                                Elon
                                Musk and other tech leaders, with the goal of building artificial general intelligence (AGI)
                                safely
                                and for the benefit of humanity. Altman believed that AGI could be the most impactful
                                technology
                                in
                                human history — and that it must be developed with care.

                            from a non-profit research lab to a "capped-profit" company, allowing it to attract

                            while
                            keeping its mission focused on safety and public benefit.

                                Altman is widely recognized as one of the most influential voices in tech today — shaping
                                the
                                future

                                and
                                the societal impact of artificial intelligence. He has testified before governments and
                                spoken
                                globally about the need for international cooperation, AI alignment, and responsible
                                innovation.
    
                                Despite his business and technical achievements, Altman remains focused on the long-term
                                consequences of AI, often saying that humanity must get it right — because there might not

                                second chance.
